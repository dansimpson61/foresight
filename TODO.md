# Foresight To-Do: The Baker's Board

Welcome to our development plan. Like baking bread, our process is simple, focused on quality, and deeply rewarding. We work with a clear recipe, focus on one loaf at a time, and take joy in the craft.

This document is our "baker's board"—the single source of truth for what we're working on, what's rising, and what we'll bake in the future.

### Our Simple Method: The Art of the Loaf

Our workflow is designed to be as joyful and clear as our code.

1.  **The Recipe (`/docs`):** Before we code, we think. Our living documents in the `/docs` folder are our recipes. Major changes to the application should begin with a small, thoughtful update to these documents to ensure we are building the right thing.

2.  **Slicing the Work (This File):** We manage our work right here. No complex tools, just a clear, focused list. When a task is complete, we remove it from the board and add a note to our [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

3.  **The Bake (The Code):** We work on one primary task at a time, giving it our full attention. The goal is to produce code that aligns with our [Ode to Joy](Ode%20to%20Joy%20-%20Ruby%20and%20Sinatra.txt)—clean, tested, maintainable, and a pleasure to read.

### The Board

#### Next Up
*(The loaf we are currently shaping. One task at a time.)*

*   **Align UI Controls with the Data Strategy:**
    *   **Goal:** Refactor the existing UI (`views/ui.slim`) and the `plan_form_controller.js` to fully support the complete data model in `docs/DATA_STRATEGY.md`.
    *   **Analysis:** The current UI has a good foundation of sliders, but it is missing several key inputs and the `buildParameters` function in the controller is using an outdated, hardcoded structure.
    *   **Scope:**
        1.  **Add Missing UI Controls:**
            *   In `views/ui.slim`, add inputs for *all* the missing parameters from the data strategy, including:
                *   `Emergency Fund`
                *   `Taxable Brokerage Cost Basis`
                *   `Other Assets` & `Liabilities`
                *   `Social Security (FRA Benefit & Claiming Age)` for both members
                *   `Pension` inputs
                *   `Annual Expenses`
                *   `Withdrawal Hierarchy` (could be a simple reorderable list or a set of dropdowns)
                *   Controls for the `Roth Conversion Strategy` itself (e.g., a text input for a "Fixed Amount").
        2.  **Refactor the Stimulus Controller:**
            *   In `public/controllers/plan_form_controller.js`, update the `static targets` array to include all the new inputs.
            *   Completely rewrite the `buildParameters` function to construct the JSON payload dynamically and accurately, matching the structure defined in `docs/DATA_STRATEGY.md`. No more hardcoded values for cost basis or spending.

#### On Deck
*(The dough that is rising. A short, prioritized list of what's next.)*

1.  **Refactor Backend to Use New Data Model:**
    *   **Goal:** Update the backend models and the `/plan` endpoint to accept and process the full data structure generated by the newly refactored UI.

2.  **Implement New Visualizations:**
    *   **Goal:** Create the two new primary charts defined in our strategy document: the "Net Worth Over Time" and the "Annual Income & Tax Details" charts. This will likely require significant work on the SVG generation logic in the `charts_controller.js`.

3.  **WCAG Accessibility Polish:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the application meets WCAG AA standards.
    *   **Scope:** Add clear focus states, ARIA labels for all controls, and ensure full keyboard navigability.

#### Someday / Maybe
*(Our pantry of good ideas for future loaves.)*

*   **Scenario Comparison Mode:** A dedicated UI to view two scenarios side-by-side, rather than toggling between them.
*   **Local Storage Persistence:** Allow users to save and name their scenarios in the browser for later use.
*   **Export to CSV/PDF:** Provide an option to download the detailed data table or a printable report.
*   **In-UI Help and Guidance:** Add small, contextual help icons (`?`) that explain complex terms like "MAGI" or "IRMAA" directly in the interface.
