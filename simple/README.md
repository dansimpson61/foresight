# Simple Foresight: An Ode to Joy

This application is a radical act of simplification, guided by our "Ode to Joy" development philosophy. It is an exercise in delivering 100% of the required capability in the most beautiful, clear, and minimal package possible.

## Core Purpose

The application answers one fundamental question for a user contemplating their financial future:

**"What is the long-term financial impact of strategically converting my Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA versus doing nothing?"**

## Core Capabilities

To fulfill this purpose, the application will:

1.  **Simulate two scenarios** over a 30-year horizon:
    *   A "Do Nothing" baseline.
    *   A "Fill to the Top of a Tax Bracket" strategy.
2.  **Calculate key financial outcomes** for each scenario, including lifetime taxes paid and the final composition of assets.
3.  **Present a clear, compelling visualization** that allows the user to immediately understand the trade-offs and consequences of their choice.

## Liberating Constraints

We achieve simplicity and joy through these constraints:

1.  **Single Purpose:** The application is built for a single, predefined financial profile. All data is hardcoded.
2.  **Minimalism:** We use the absolute minimum number of files, classes, and abstractions required. Simplicity is our love language.
3.  **Focus:** We only implement the two core strategies.
4.  **Immutable Stack:** We use Sinatra, Slim, and a light touch of Stimulus.
