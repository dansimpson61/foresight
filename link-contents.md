I'm trying to model retirement income so that i can represent it in code. Please discuss this model with me from your expertise:



 Here is a simplified 'static' retirement income model:

1. We have a 'Required Income' based on personal necessity and choices;

2. We have 'Outside Income' from different sources.

3. If outside income is less than required income, then we need to withdraw distributions from our IRAs, beginning with Traditional IRAs followed by Roth IRAs.

Of course. I can certainly discuss this model from a Federal and New York State tax perspective. Your proposed static model is an excellent foundational framework for understanding retirement cash flow. Let's analyze each component and explore the tax implications and other considerations that would enhance its accuracy for planning purposes.

Analysis of Your Retirement Income Model
Your model has three core components:

Required Income: The target spending goal.

Outside Income: Non-IRA sources like Social Security, pensions, etc.

Withdrawal Strategy: Tapping Traditional IRAs, then Roth IRAs, to fill the gap.

Here is a detailed tax-centric analysis of this structure.

1. 'Required Income' - The After-Tax Target
This is the starting point for any plan. It's crucial to recognize that this is an after-tax number. To accurately model withdrawals, you must calculate the pre-tax income required to meet this after-tax goal.

For example, if your "Required Income" is $80,000 and your effective (total) tax rate is 15%, you would need to generate approximately $94,118 in pre-tax income ($80,000 / (1 - 0.15)). The goal of a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy is to minimize the amount of pre-tax income needed to hit your after-tax target.

2. 'Outside Income' - A Multi-Layered Tax Situation
This is where the tax analysis becomes critical, as different income streams are treated very differently at the Federal and New York State levels.

Social Security Benefits

Federal Treatment: The taxability of your Social Security benefits depends on your "provisional income."

Provisional Income = Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) + Nontaxable Interest + 50% of Social Security Benefits

Based on this calculation, up to 85% of your Social Security benefits can be included in your federal taxable income. This creates a "tax torpedo" effect, where each additional dollar of income from other sources (like a Traditional IRA distribution) can cause $0.50 or $0.85 of your Social Security benefits to become taxable, significantly increasing your marginal tax rate.

New York State Treatment: This is a major difference. New York State does not tax Social Security benefits. They are fully exempt from NYS income tax and are subtracted when calculating your New York Adjusted Gross Income (NYAGI).

Pensions & Annuities (from private or public employers)

Federal Treatment: Distributions from qualified employer plans like a pension or 401(k) are generally taxed as ordinary income.

New York State Treatment: If you are age 59.5 or older, New York allows you to exclude up to $20,000 of income from qualifying pensions and annuities from your NYAGI. It is important to note that distributions from IRAs (Traditional, SEP, SIMPLE) do not qualify for this exclusion.

Investment Income (in a taxable brokerage account)

Federal Treatment: The tax treatment varies.

Long-Term Capital Gains & Qualified Dividends: Taxed at preferential rates (0%, 15%, or 20%) depending on your taxable income.

Interest & Short-Term Capital Gains: Taxed as ordinary income at your marginal tax bracket.

New York State Treatment: New York does not have a separate, lower tax rate for capital gains. All investment income (capital gains, dividends, interest) is taxed as ordinary income at NYS marginal rates.

3. Withdrawal Strategy: Traditional IRA then Roth IRA
This is a very common strategy, often referred to as "conventional wisdom," based on the logic of deferring taxes as long as possible and allowing tax-free Roth assets to grow for the longest period. However, this static approach has significant tax implications and potential drawbacks.

Traditional IRA Distributions

Federal Treatment: Every dollar withdrawn from a Traditional IRA (assuming it was funded with pre-tax contributions) is taxed as ordinary income. These distributions increase your AGI, which has several cascading effects:

Increases Taxable Social Security: As mentioned above, higher AGI from IRA withdrawals can make more of your Social Security benefits taxable.

Triggers IRMAA Surcharges: Your Medicare Part B and Part D premiums are based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) from two years prior. Higher IRA withdrawals can push your MAGI over certain thresholds, triggering the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA), which are significant surcharges on your premiums.

Pushes You into Higher Tax Brackets: Large, required withdrawals can easily push you from a 12% bracket into the 22% or 24% brackets.

New York State Treatment: Distributions are also taxed as ordinary income by NYS. Remember, these distributions are not eligible for the $20,000 pension exclusion.

Roth IRA Distributions

Federal & New York State Treatment: Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are 100% tax-free at both the federal and state levels. A distribution is qualified if the account has been open for at least five years and you are over age 59.5.

Key Advantage: Because Roth distributions are not considered income for tax purposes, they do not increase your AGI, NYAGI, or your MAGI for Social Security and IRMAA calculations. This is a powerful tool for managing your taxable income in retirement.

Expanding the Model: Introducing Dynamic Concepts
Your static model is a great starting point, but a more robust model for coding or planning would incorporate these dynamic elements:

Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs): Your model assumes you only withdraw what you need. However, starting at age 73 or 75 (depending on your birth year), federal law requires you to take RMDs from your traditional retirement accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.). These RMDs might be much larger than your "Required Income," forcing you to realize a large amount of taxable income whether you need the cash or not. Your model must account for these non-discretionary, forced withdrawals.

Tax Bracket Management (A "Pro-Rata" or "Blended" Withdrawal Approach): The "Traditional first" strategy can be inefficient. A more dynamic approach would be to "fill up" the lower tax brackets each year.

Example Scenario: Instead of taking a $100,000 withdrawal from a Traditional IRA and paying a high marginal rate on the top portion, a retiree might:

Take $50,000 from the Traditional IRA (filling the 10% and 12% federal brackets).

Take the remaining $50,000 they need from their Roth IRA, which is tax-free.

This blended approach can keep overall taxes lower over the long term and help manage MAGI to avoid IRMAA thresholds.

Roth Conversions: Before RMDs begin, there is often a "golden window" of low-income years (e.g., between retirement at age 65 and RMDs at age 75). During these years, it can be highly advantageous to strategically convert funds from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. You pay ordinary income tax on the converted amount now, but that money then grows tax-free forever, is not subject to RMDs, and can be withdrawn tax-free later when you might be in a higher tax bracket due to RMDs.

Your model is an excellent foundation. By layering in the specific tax treatments of each income source (at both the federal and NYS level) and considering dynamic factors like RMDs and bracket management, you can create a much more powerful and realistic representation of retirement finances.

Just my two cents.

Excellent. Taking inspiration from the principles of joyful development—simplicity, clarity, and expressiveness —we can describe a more complete retirement income model.￼

This model extends your static framework to incorporate the key tax dynamics that govern retirement income, presented as a series of simple, declarative statements that can be interpreted as a domain model.

A Joyful Retirement Income Model
Core Concepts
A Retiree has a Date_of_Birth and a State_of_Residence.

A Year has associated Federal_Tax_Brackets and State_Tax_Brackets.

The Target_Spending is the desired annual after-tax income.

The Required_Pretax_Income is the gross income needed to produce the Target_Spending after all taxes are paid.

Income Sources
An income source has a Gross_Amount.

Social_Security_Benefit is an income source.

Its federal taxability depends on Provisional_Income.

It is not taxed by New York State.

Pension_Income is an income source.

It is taxed as ordinary income federally.

New York State allows a $20,000 exclusion for a Retiree aged 59.5 or older.

Investment_Income is an income source.

It is composed of Interest, Dividends, and Capital_Gains.

Federally, Long_Term_Capital_Gains and Qualified_Dividends have preferential tax rates.

New York State taxes all Investment_Income as ordinary income.

Accounts
A Traditional_IRA is an account with a Pre_Tax_Balance.

A withdrawal from this account is taxable income.

It is subject to a Required_Minimum_Distribution (RMD) after a certain age. The RMD is a non-discretionary withdrawal that becomes taxable income.

A Roth_IRA is an account with a Post_Tax_Balance.

A qualified withdrawal from this account is not taxable income.

It has no RMD for the original owner.

A Taxable_Brokerage_Account is an account with a Balance.

Selling assets from this account generates Capital_Gains or Capital_Losses.

The Annual Process: A Simple Flow
Start the Year. Determine the Retiree's age.

Identify all non-discretionary income for the Year (This includes RMDs from a Traditional_IRA, Social_Security_Benefit, and Pension_Income).

Sum this non-discretionary income to find the Base_Taxable_Income.

Calculate the taxes on Base_Taxable_Income to determine the Base_After_Tax_Income.

Compare Base_After_Tax_Income to the Target_Spending to find the Remaining_Spending_Need.

If a Remaining_Spending_Need exists, calculate the Pretax_Withdrawal_Amount required to meet it.

Fulfill the Pretax_Withdrawal_Amount by choosing a source.

A withdrawal from the Traditional_IRA provides funds but increases taxable income.

A withdrawal from the Roth_IRA provides funds with no tax impact.

The model's goal is to choose a withdrawal source, or a blend of sources, that meets the Remaining_Spending_Need while minimizing the total tax liability for the Year.

Key Calculations to Model
A function calculates Total_Taxable_Income for Federal and NYS separately.

A function calculates Provisional_Income to determine the taxable portion of Social_Security_Benefit.

A function calculates Modified_Adjusted_Gross_Income (MAGI). This determines Medicare IRMAA premium surcharges, which is an expense.

This model provides a clear, maintainable, and extensible foundation for representing the key financial and tax variables of retirement. ￼

Just my two cents.

Am i correct that your model will prioritize minimizing current-year tax liability over long-term life-of-the-plan tax liability?

Yes, your interpretation is correct. The model, as described in that simple, declarative flow, is designed to be myopic. It solves for the immediate goal: meeting the spending need for the current year while minimizing the tax liability for that same year.

This approach has the benefit of simplicity and aligns with the "Keep It Simple" principle. However, it does not account for the long-term, cumulative tax liability over the entire duration of the retirement plan.

A more advanced, long-term optimization model would consider trade-offs across many years. For example:

RMD Management: A long-term model might intentionally realize more income in a low-income year (e.g., through a Roth conversion) to reduce the future balance of a Traditional IRA. This could result in a slightly higher tax bill today but prevent forced, high-tax RMDs in future years that would push you into a much higher tax bracket.

Asset Growth: It would also factor in the expected growth of assets. Leaving money in a Roth IRA allows for decades of tax-free growth, which can be more valuable than the immediate tax savings from pulling from a Traditional IRA.

Future Tax Law Changes: While speculative, a comprehensive model might allow for assumptions about future changes in tax brackets or regulations.

In essence, you have correctly identified the distinction between a tactical, single-year optimization (which my simple model describes) and a strategic, multi-year optimization. The former is easier to model and execute, while the latter is more complex but aims to minimize the total tax paid over a lifetime.

Just my two cents.

Let's simplify the long-term dynamics to inform a less myopic static model. 'Think locally; act globally' in temporal terms is equivalent to 'Think today; act for all time.'

￼

Excellent. Applying the principle of "'Think today; act for all time'" to our model is the very essence of strategic tax planning. We can incorporate this long-term perspective into the static, single-year model by introducing a few key concepts that guide the current year's decisions based on future implications.

The primary long-term tax risk in retirement is the future growth of the Traditional_IRA balance, which will lead to larger, forced Required_Minimum_Distributions (RMDs) at higher tax rates. The primary opportunity is to proactively manage your taxable income in lower-income years.

Here is a way to simplify these long-term dynamics into a less myopic static model.

An Enhanced Model: Acting for the Long Term
We can add two guiding principles to the annual process.

1. The Tax_Bracket_Ceiling Principle
This principle establishes a proactive goal for taxable income each year, independent of spending needs. It treats unused space in low tax brackets as a valuable asset to be "harvested" annually.

New Core Concept: A Retiree defines a Desired_Tax_Bracket_Ceiling for the year (e.g., the top of the 12%, 22%, or 24% federal tax bracket).

New Annual Action (The "Look Ahead" Step):

At the start of the Year, calculate the Base_Taxable_Income from all non-discretionary sources (Pensions, Social Security, RMDs).

Calculate the Tax_Bracket_Headroom, which is the difference between the Desired_Tax_Bracket_Ceiling and the Base_Taxable_Income.

If Tax_Bracket_Headroom is greater than $0, the model should execute a Roth_Conversion from the Traditional_IRA equal to this amount.

Effect: This action intentionally realizes taxable income now at a known, controlled rate. It fills up the desired tax bracket, paying tax today to reduce the principal in the Traditional_IRA. This directly reduces the size of the future "tax bomb" from RMDs, embodying the 'act for all time' philosophy.

2. The Preserve_the_Best_Asset Withdrawal Strategy
This principle re-arranges the withdrawal hierarchy for spending needs. Instead of solely minimizing this year's tax, the goal is to preserve the most valuable long-term asset, which is the Roth_IRA (due to its tax-free growth and lack of RMDs).

Modified Annual Process (The "Spending" Step):

After accounting for the Roth_Conversion and all Base_After_Tax_Income, determine the Remaining_Spending_Need.

If a need exists, fulfill it using the following withdrawal hierarchy:

First: Withdraw from the Taxable_Brokerage_Account. This income is taxed at preferential capital gains rates (federally) but is less flexible than Roth assets.

Second: Withdraw from the Traditional_IRA. This creates ordinary taxable income. This should only be done if it does not push the Retiree's total taxable income past their Desired_Tax_Bracket_Ceiling.

Last: Withdraw from the Roth_IRA. This tax-free source is used last to preserve it, allowing it to grow tax-free for as long as possible to be used in years where income is unexpectedly high or for late-in-life expenses.

By adding these two concepts, the model is no longer myopic. It makes strategic decisions in the current year—executing Roth conversions and thoughtfully sourcing withdrawals—with the explicit goal of creating a better financial and tax outcome over the entire life of the plan.

Just my two cents.

Define each object class in this domain model. Assume the intended users are a husband and wife nearing retirement. I understand each to include it's attributes and behaviors (methods). Be guided by our Ode to Joy development philosophy.

Following the principles of joyful development—where code is expressive, clear, and has a sense of "rightness"—here are definitions for the object classes in our retirement income domain model, tailored for a husband and wife. ￼
￼
￼
￼

Each class is designed with a clear and focused purpose, promoting a structure that is both easy to understand and maintain. ￼
￼
￼
￼

1. Person
This class represents an individual. It holds information unique to one person.

Attributes:

name: The person's name, for clarity in reports.

date_of_birth: The person's birth date, used to calculate age-related rules like RMDs.

Behaviors:

age_in(year): Calculates the person's age for a given year.

is_rmd_eligible_in(year): Simply answers whether this person has reached the age where Required Minimum Distributions begin.

2. Household
This class represents the couple as a single financial entity. It is the central object that holds their collective goals and assets.

Attributes:

members: A collection of the Person objects in the household.

filing_status: Their tax filing status, typically 'Married Filing Jointly'.

state_of_residence: Their home state, e.g., 'New York', which dictates state tax rules.

accounts: A collection of all their financial Account objects.

income_sources: A collection of their recurring IncomeSource objects.

target_spending: The annual after-tax income goal they wish to achieve.

desired_tax_bracket_ceiling: The highest federal tax bracket they are comfortable filling each year, which guides the "act for all time" strategy.

Behaviors:

assets_by_type: Provides a summary of total assets, grouped by tax type (pre-tax, post-tax, taxable).

determine_annual_rmd(year): Calculates the total RMD the household must take for a given year by summing the RMDs for each eligible member and their accounts.

3. Account (and its types)
This represents a financial account. Each type of account "knows" its own tax rules, embodying the principle of encapsulation. ￼

TraditionalIRA

Attributes: owner (the Person who owns it), balance.

Behaviors:

withdraw(amount): Returns the cash amount and reports the full amount as taxable income.

convert_to_roth(amount): Simulates a conversion, reducing its balance and reporting the amount as taxable income.

calculate_rmd(owner_age): Calculates its RMD based on the owner's age and the IRS life expectancy tables.

RothIRA

Attributes: owner, balance, is_qualified (a boolean based on age and 5-year rule).

Behaviors:

withdraw(amount): Returns the cash amount and reports zero taxable income if is_qualified is true.

TaxableBrokerage

Attributes: owners, balance, total_cost_basis.

Behaviors:

withdraw(amount): Returns the cash amount and reports the proportional capital gain as investment income.

4. IncomeSource (and its types)
This represents a stream of recurring income. Like accounts, each type understands its unique tax treatment.

Pension

Attributes: recipient (the Person), annual_payout.

Behaviors:

taxable_amount(state, recipient_age): Returns the taxable portion of the payout, applying state-specific rules (like the NYS $20,000 exclusion).

SocialSecurityBenefit

Attributes: recipient, annual_benefit.

Behaviors:

federal_taxable_amount(provisional_income): Returns the portion of the benefit that is subject to federal income tax based on the provisional income formula. It "knows" that its NYS taxable amount is always zero.

5. TaxYear
This class acts as the rulebook for a single year. It holds all the tax parameters, keeping them separate from the people and their money.

Attributes:

year: The calendar year, e.g., 2025.

federal_law: An object containing the federal tax brackets, standard deduction, and other rules for the year.

state_law: An object containing the tax rules for the household's state of residence.

Behaviors:

calculate_liability(income_details): Takes a detailed income summary and calculates the final federal and state tax owed.

calculate_magi(income_details): Calculates the Modified Adjusted Gross Income to check against IRMAA thresholds.

6. AnnualPlanner
This is the conductor of the orchestra. It uses all the other objects to perform the annual retirement plan, making the process smooth and effortless. ￼

Attributes:

household: The Household to plan for.

tax_year: The TaxYear providing the rules.

Behaviors:

generate_plan(): This single, clear method executes the entire annual strategy:

It first determines all non-discretionary income (RMDs, Pensions, Social Security).

It then executes the "act for all time" step by calculating Tax_Bracket_Headroom and performing a strategic Roth_Conversion if beneficial.

Next, it calculates the Remaining_Spending_Need.

Finally, it executes the "preserve the best asset" withdrawal strategy to meet that need.

It returns a simple, readable summary of the year's financial events.

Just my two cents.
